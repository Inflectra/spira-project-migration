# Overview
This code allows an entire project to be exported to a backup file, for archiving and offline storage of SpiraTeam projects. The base minimum SpiraTeam version required is 3.2 (014), and there is some data that is not backed up, see the link below for complete information. This version of the code is specifically for use with version v5.x of SpiraTeam.

The migration tool does not support upgrading versions, i.e. you need to have the same version of SpiraTeam for both the import and export phase. If you have two different versions of SpiraTeam, you must first upgrade the older installation to the same version as the newer one.
